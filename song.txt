Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do

When you call me at night
While you're out getting high with your friends
(High with your friends)
Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said
(You've ever said)
